# Static Node.JS and Express site

## Description
This project creates a portfolio site that showcases projects I have built in the Treehouse Apprenticeship Program. It includes a main page, an about page, projects page and an error page.

To complete the project I used JSON, Express and Pug, Node.js, CSS, and the project files provided by Treehouse. I also followed the Mockups and the html examples also provided by Treehouse.

• Created error.pug which displays error.message, error.status, error.stack, when an non-existing URL is requested
• Made the following changes to the style.css file:
    • changed background color of body
    • changed background color of #my-info
    • added text shadow to #my-info
    • circled the profile picture
    • flipped profile picture on hover
    • added and centered picture for error page
